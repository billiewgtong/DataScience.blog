In this project, I will analyze Major Crimes, Airbnb listings, and asymmetric information in Boston. There are key 3 questions that I answer in this project:

    I. What types of major crimes are occuring and where they are occuring?

    II. Can a large percentage of variation of Airbnb rental prices be predicted with available listing charcteristics?

    III. Does major crime frequency associated with each listing (within a ~5km radius) in the last year have practical significance on improving the percentage of variation of Airbnb rental prices explained by factors available?
